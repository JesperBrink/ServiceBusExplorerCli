# ServiceBusExplorerCli

WIP!

This project is a small and simple tool for interacting with [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview). The purpose is not to have all the same features as [Service Bus Explorer](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer), but instead to be a simple alternative with a few essential features for interacting with Azure Service Bus. (Well, actually I just really like using the terminal, so why use a GUI when you could use a CLI!).

## Supported commands
- [x] List the names of all queues or topics
- [x] List the names of all the subscriptions in a topic
- [x] List all queus/subscriptions with messages in their DeadLetterQueue.
- [ ] Peek messages
- [ ] Peek deadletter messages
- [ ] Resubmit deadletter messages
